Here’s a complete and professional `README.md` for your **Supply Chain Product Tracking Blockchain** project:

# 📦 Supply Chain Product Tracking Blockchain

A simple blockchain-based application for tracking product movements through different stages of a supply chain. This CLI-based system simulates how manufacturers, transporters, and retailers can securely log and trace product history using blockchain principles.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ⛓️ Blockchain structure with mining and hash validation
* ✅ Only authorized entities can add transactions
* 📦 Track product movements (from manufacture to delivery)
* 🔐 Tamper-proof chain validation
* 🛠️ CLI interface for interacting with the blockchain
* 🕵️ Track products by ID across the blockchain history

---

## 🧱 Entities Involved

The system includes the following pre-authorized roles:

| Entity ID | Role         |
| --------- | ------------ |
| M001      | Manufacturer |
| T001      | Transporter  |
| R001      | Retailer     |

## 📂 Project Structure

```
supply_chain_blockchain/
│
├── supply_chain.py       # Main Python script (contains blockchain logic and CLI)
├── README.md             # Project documentation
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
  *(Tested on Python 3.8+)*

No external packages are required. Uses standard libraries:

* `hashlib`
* `time`
* `json`

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open a terminal in the project directory.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python supply_chain.py
```

---

## 🖥️ CLI Menu

You will see a menu like this:

```
=== Supply Chain Product Tracking Blockchain ===
1. Add product movement (Authorized only)
2. Mine block (Validate transactions)
3. Show blockchain
4. Validate blockchain
5. Track product by ID
6. Exit
```

### Option Details

| Option | Description                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Adds a transaction (movement) by a valid entity |
| 2      | Mines all pending transactions into a new block |
| 3      | Prints the full blockchain                      |
| 4      | Validates the integrity of the chain            |
| 5      | Shows movement history of a specific product    |
| 6      | Exits the application                           |

---

## 📈 Example Workflow

1. **Manufacturer logs movement** of product from factory to warehouse.
2. **Transporter logs delivery** from warehouse to store.
3. Each action is added to pending transactions.
4. **Authorized entity mines** the block to add the movement to the chain.
5. **Product history can be tracked** using the product ID.

---

## ✅ Sample Output

```bash
✅ Movement added by Manufacturer
✅ Block mined: 00a4f9c2d8...
📦 Block validated by Manufacturer

🔍 Tracking history for Product ID: P123
{
    "product_id": "P123",
    "from": "Factory",
    "to": "Warehouse",
    "handled_by": "Manufacturer",
    "timestamp": "Thu Aug 22 10:02:31 2025"
}
```

---

## 🛡️ Chain Integrity

Each block includes:

* SHA-256 hash of its content
* Hash of the previous block
* Nonce (for proof of work)

If any block is tampered with, chain validation will fail.

---

## 📌 Notes

* All transactions are stored in memory (no persistent DB).
* This is a **simulation**, not meant for production.
* Difficulty is set to `2` (adjustable).
